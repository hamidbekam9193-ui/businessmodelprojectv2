  description: >
    Your task is to generate a clear, professional, and well-structured Company Summary section for a business plan. This section should give a high-level overview of the company based on user-provided information.
    First, reason step by step to ensure no detail is missed. Follow these stages while writing your final report:
    1. Consider the values of the following variables provided by the user from a questionnaire:
    Business Name: {business_name}
    Establishment Year: {start_year}
    The reason for establishing the company: {business_reason}
    Mission: {mission_vision}
    Legal Structure: {legal_structure}
    Financial Funding of the company: {financial_funding}
    Business Sector the company operates in: {business_sector}
    The name of the most relevant customer segment: {segment_name}
    The demographics of the most relevant customer segment: {segment_demographics}
    The characteristics of the most relevant customer segment: {segment_characteristics}
    Products or services offered by the company: {product_service_description}
    What characterizes the end consumer of the product or service: {end_consumer_characteristics}
    What types of end consumers are there: {end_consumer_characteristics_2}
    Value propositions of the company: {value_propositions}
    Team members of the company and their competencies, experience and education: {team_members}

    Use these variables as follows:
    - Use exact values for factual information
    - Interpret and rephrase broader concepts to create a coherent narrative
    - To be coherent, the values of the variables should be seamlessly integrated into the text to ensure a smooth flow of information
    - Avoid making assumptions or using speculative language
    - Focus on concrete facts and data provided
    - DO NOT highlight variable values in bold or any other special formatting
    - Use the company name primarily, and limit alternative references to maximum 2-3 instances per section (e.g., "the organization", "the business") to avoid excessive variation
    - NEVER mention what the company does NOT do or what is NOT significant, even though you received this information from the variables; if the received information implies that the company does not do something, just move on - focus only on what the company DOES and what IS relevant

    When dealing with the variables, follow these transformation guidelines:
    - DO NOT list items directly (e.g., "The company offers: item1, item2, item3")
    - DO NOT use bullet points or numbered lists
    - Instead, transform them into flowing narrative by:
      * Grouping related items and describing them as a category
      * Using connecting words to create natural transitions
      * Integrating items into complete sentences
      * Focusing on patterns and themes rather than individual items
    - For activities and resources, describe them in terms of their purpose and impact rather than listing them
    - For team members, focus on organizational structure and capabilities rather than listing individual roles
    - Transform variable values into natural language by:
      * Using active voice and dynamic verbs
      * Creating logical connections between related concepts
      * Describing relationships and impacts rather than just stating facts
      * Using industry-appropriate terminology and context
      * Avoiding direct quotes or citations of variable values
    - When integrating multiple variables:
      * Look for natural connections between different pieces of information
      * Create cause-and-effect relationships where appropriate
      * Use transitional phrases to connect related concepts
      * Build a coherent story rather than just presenting facts
    - Minimize repetition of value propositions - mention them clearly and avoid repeating the same concepts in different sections

    Examples of good and bad usage:
    BAD: "The company's value propositions are: faster delivery, better quality, lower prices"
    GOOD: "The organization distinguishes itself through its commitment to efficient delivery, maintaining high quality standards, and offering competitive pricing"

    BAD: "The customer characteristics include: tech-savvy, urban, young professionals"
    GOOD: "The target market consists of young urban professionals who are comfortable with technology and value convenience"

    BAD: "The team members are: John (CEO), Sarah (CTO), Mike (CFO)"
    GOOD: "The business is led by an experienced management team, with leadership roles in executive, technical, and financial operations"

    BAD: "While online communities are not currently a significant factor, the company does offer..."
    GOOD: "The company offers comprehensive customer support through multiple channels"
    
    2. Break down the company summary into the following required components:
    - Business overview: Brief introduction including name, starting year, reason for establishing, legal structure, financial funding, and business sector characteristics
    - Mission and objectives: Company mission and objectives based on the information and context
    - Customer focus and value delivery: Integrated section covering customer segment characteristics, their key pain points, how the company's products/services address these pain points through specific value propositions
    - Organizational capabilities: Key team competencies and organizational characteristics
    
    3. Plan the content for each section using bullet points.

    4. Then, generate the full professional narrative based on the structured points above. Do not include the bullet points in the final output. Write clearly, concisely, and formally, and do not include the reasoning steps in the final output.
    Do not make up any data or information, base your report on the information provided by the user in the variables.
    Remember: this section is an overview and should not go into deep details about any of the sections.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed markdown report, which is between 2000 and 4000 characters and consists of the following subheadings in this order:
    Business overview
    Mission and objectives
    Customer focus and value delivery
    Organizational capabilities
    
    The output should be a coherent, professional and well-structured text that flows logically between sections and connects different parts together. Avoid bullet points, speculative language, and negative statements about what the company does not do. Focus on concrete facts and data provided.

    - Strategic partnerships: Name the main partners and describe their role. Explain the benefits they bring and the company's level of dependency on them
    - Cost structure and resources: Describe which components of the operations are most cost-intensive and why. Include both material and intangible resources that are essential to the business
    - Team and organization: Describe the team members and their competencies, experience and education
    
    3. Plan the content for each section using bullet points.

    4. Then, generate the full professional narrative based on the structured points above. Do not include the bullet points in the final output. Write clearly, concisely, and formally, and do not include the reasoning steps in the final output.
    Do not make up any data or information, base your report on the information provided by the user in the variables. You can use the information from the previous agent as context.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed markdown report, which is between 2000 and 4000 characters and consists of the following things in this order:
    Key operational activities
    Strategic partnerships
    Cost structure and resources
    Team and organization
    
    The output should be a coherent, professional and well-structured text that flows logically between sections and connects different parts together. Avoid bullet points, speculative language, and negative statements. Focus on concrete facts and data provided.

create_financial_plan:
  description: >
    Your task is to create a detailed financial plan based on the information provided by the user and your general knowledge.
    Reason step by step before generating the final text. Follow this structured process to ensure no detail is overlooked:
    1. Consider the values of the following variables provided by the user from a questionnaire:
    The financial funding of the company: {financial_funding}
    If the company is applying for funding, then the amount is stored in this variable: {funding_amount}
    The purpose of the funding: {funding_purpose}

    Use these variables as follows:
    - Use exact values for factual information
    - Interpret and rephrase broader concepts to create a coherent narrative
    - To be coherent, the values of the variables should be seamlessly integrated into the text to ensure a smooth flow of information
    - Avoid making assumptions or using speculative language
    - Focus on concrete facts and data provided
    - DO NOT highlight variable values in bold or any other special formatting
    - Use the company name primarily, and limit alternative references to maximum 2-3 instances per section (e.g., "the organization", "the business") to avoid excessive variation
    - NEVER mention what the company does NOT do or what is NOT significant, even though you received this information from the variables; if the received information implies that the company does not do something, just move on - focus only on what the company DOES and what IS relevant

    When dealing with the variables, follow these transformation guidelines:
    - DO NOT list items directly (e.g., "The funding sources are: source1, source2, source3")
    - DO NOT use bullet points or numbered lists
    - Instead, transform them into flowing narrative by:
      * Grouping related items and describing them as a category
      * Using connecting words to create natural transitions
      * Integrating items into complete sentences
      * Focusing on patterns and themes rather than individual items
    - For activities and resources, describe them in terms of their purpose and impact rather than listing them
    - For team members, focus on organizational structure and capabilities rather than listing individual roles
    - Transform variable values into natural language by:
      * Using active voice and dynamic verbs
      * Creating logical connections between related concepts
      * Describing relationships and impacts rather than just stating facts
      * Using industry-appropriate terminology and context
      * Avoiding direct quotes or citations of variable values
    - When integrating multiple variables:
      * Look for natural connections between different pieces of information
      * Create cause-and-effect relationships where appropriate
      * Use transitional phrases to connect related concepts
      * Build a coherent story rather than just presenting facts

    Examples of good and bad usage:
    BAD: "The funding sources include: investors, loans, grants"
    GOOD: "The organization's financial foundation is built on a diverse mix of investment capital, traditional financing, and grant funding"

    BAD: "The funding purposes are: expansion, equipment, marketing"
    GOOD: "The business will strategically allocate capital to support expansion initiatives, enhance operational capabilities, and strengthen market presence"

    BAD: "The financial structure consists of: equity, debt, retained earnings"
    GOOD: "The enterprise's financial structure is balanced between equity investments, debt financing, and internally generated capital"
    
    2. Break down the financial plan into the following required components:
    - Financial background and current capital structure: Describe how the company is currently financed and how it uses its initial funding.
    - Capital needs and funding strategy: If a funding amount is provided, specify how much is being sought and its business purpose. Explain how this investment supports the company's growth and operations
    
    3. Plan the content for each section using bullet points.

    4. Then, generate the full professional narrative based on the structured points above. Do not include the bullet points in the final output. Write clearly, concisely, and formally, and do not include the reasoning steps in the final output.
    Do not make up any data or information, base your report on the information provided by the user in the variables. You can use the information from the previous agent as context.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed markdown report, which is between 1200 and 2000 characters and consists of the following things in this order:
    Financial background and current capital structure
    Capital needs and funding strategy
    
    The output should be a coherent, professional and well-structured text that flows logically between sections and connects different parts together. Avoid bullet points, speculative language, and negative statements. Focus on concrete facts and data provided.

consolidate_plan:
  description: >
    Your task is to combine the different sections of the business plan created by previous agents into a single, unified markdown document.
    Each section was written by a specialized agent and contains part of the business plan.
    You should merge these sections clearly and preserve their original order and structure.
    Organize the headers in the following order:
    # Company Summary
    {{ context[0]}}
    # Product/Service Design
    {{ context[1]}}
    # Market Analysis
    {{ context[2]}}
    # Marketing Strategy
    {{ context[3]}}
    # Operating Strategy
    {{ context[4]}}
    # Financial Plan
    {{ context[5]}}
    Do not edit or rewrite the content — just organize them into a single flowing markdown document for evaluation and refinement.
  expected_output: >
    A complete markdown-formatted business plan composed by merging all previous sections in order.

evaluate_plan:
  description: >
    Review the full business plan provided. Your job is to identify and flag specific issues that need correction based ONLY on the information provided in the questionnaire.
    Focus on the following aspects and ensure there are NO instances of these issues:
    1. Coherence and Flow:
       - Ensure there are no abrupt transitions between sections
       - Verify that ideas are properly connected with transitional phrases
       - Confirm that the text flows naturally throughout
    
    2. Professional Writing Standards:
       - Ensure there are no bullet points or direct listings anywhere in the text
       - Verify there is no speculative language or assumptions beyond provided data
       - Confirm the tone is consistently professional throughout
    
    3. Variable Integration:
       - Ensure variables are seamlessly integrated into narrative flow
       - Verify that list-type variables are transformed into flowing text
       - Confirm that no variables are directly cited or quoted
    
    4. Content Quality Issues:
       - Ensure there are no contradictory statements (e.g., mentioning both presence and absence of after-sales)
       - Verify there is no excessive repetition of value propositions across sections
       - Confirm there are no negative statements about what the company doesn't do
       - Ensure company references are not overly varied (limit to company name plus 2-3 alternatives per section)
    
    5. Factual Accuracy:
       - Verify all statements are based solely on provided questionnaire data
       - Ensure no information is fabricated or assumed
       - Confirm no speculative improvements are suggested
    
    STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Flag every instance where the same value proposition concept is repeated across multiple sections
    - Identify any contradictory information about company offerings or capabilities
    - Mark any use of negative phrasing (e.g., "not significant", "does not offer", "while X is not...")
    - Note excessive use of company synonyms within the same section
    - Do NOT evaluate the Financial Plan section - this section is intentionally concise
    
    For each issue found, provide the specific section name and the exact problematic text that needs correction.
  expected_output: >
    A bulleted list of specific issues found, each with the section name and exact problematic text that needs correction. Focus on repetition, contradictions, negative statements, and flow issues. Exclude any feedback about the Financial Plan section.
